## Little More about Myself
Hi! I'm {{ site.author.name | escape }}, a full-stack Android developer with a passion for building innovative and user-friendly apps. I've been coding since my early days in college, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and tackle challenging problems.

When it comes to Android development, I have a diverse skillset that spans across the entire stack. I'm proficient in Kotlin, Compose, MVVM architecture, and various libraries like Hilt, Room, Retrofit, and WorkManager. I'm also well-versed in data structures and algorithms, which helps me design efficient and robust solutions.

Beyond pure Android development, I'm also familiar with backend technologies like Ktor, JWT, and Postgres, allowing me to build full-fledged applications with seamless integration.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm also passionate about problem-solving and contributing to the developer community. I've participated in several programming contests, achieving remarkable rankings at national, regional levels. I've also actively volunteered as a problem setter, judge, and trainer for the ACM programming club at my university, helping others grow their programming skills.

I'm confident that my diverse skillset, passion for learning, and collaborative spirit make me a valuable asset to any team. I'm eager to discuss how my expertise can contribute to your projects and bring your ideas to life!

Thank you.
